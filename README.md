# Sample / Value Proposition

How many lines of code/steps/interactions with the ide, clicks, wiggles of the mouse, etc, does it take to:

- draw two sprites. 
- where one of the spirtes is in the center of a 1080p window. 
- where the other sprite is orbiting around the first sprite with an expanding and contracting radius. 
- and when you press a key on the keyboard it pauses and unpauses the game.
